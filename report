Report:

The given code is a C program that simulates a teacher and three students who are completing assignments using shared resources.
The shared resources are represented using a 2D integer array student with dimensions 3x4. Each row represents a student and each column represents a resource.

The pthread_mutex_t variable lck is used to ensure thread synchronization and protect access to shared resources. It is initialized using pthread_mutex_init().

The teacher() function is a thread function that takes input from the user for the two resources on the shared table (ch1 and ch2). It is responsible for setting
the values of ch1 and ch2 after acquiring the lock on the mutex using pthread_mutex_lock() and releasing it using pthread_mutex_unlock().

The student1(), student2(), and student3() functions are also thread functions representing three different students. They simulate the completion of assignments by 
setting the value of the corresponding resource in the student array to 1 after acquiring the lock on the mutex using pthread_mutex_lock() and releasing it using
pthread_mutex_unlock().

The main function of the program contains a loop that continues until all three students have completed their assignments (student[1][4]==1 && student[2][4]==1 && 
student[3][4]==1). Inside the loop, the teacher thread is created and joined using pthread_create() and pthread_join(), respectively. Depending on the choices made 
by the teacher for ch1 and ch2, the corresponding student thread is created and joined. If the choices made by the teacher do not match any of the conditions, 
an error message is printed.

Overall, the code demonstrates the usage of pthreads and mutex for thread synchronization in a simple simulation of shared resources being used by multiple threads.
However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure correct execution:

Race condition: The shared student array is accessed and modified by multiple threads (teacher(), student1(), student2(), and student3()) without proper 
synchronization, which can lead to race conditions and undefined behavior. The mutex lck should be used consistently to protect access to the shared student
array in all the functions.

Input validation: The code takes input from the user without any validation, which can lead to incorrect values being stored in ch1 and ch2. Proper input 
validation should be implemented to ensure correct behavior.

Resource allocation logic: The logic for allocating resources to students based on the choices made by the teacher needs to be reviewed carefully to ensure
correct assignment of resources and prevent deadlocks or incorrect assignments.

Loop condition: The loop condition that checks for completion of assignments (student[1][4]==1 && student[2][4]==1 && student[3][4]==1) may not be sufficient 
to exit the loop correctly. It depends on the assignment completion logic, which is not clear from the given code.

Error handling: The error handling for thread creation, mutex lock/unlock, and other operations that can fail should be implemented to handle errors gracefully.

It is recommended to thoroughly review and test the code, addressing the above-mentioned issues, to ensure correct and reliable execution.
